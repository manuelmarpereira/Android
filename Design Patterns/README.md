Design Patterns
===============================================

Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. <br>
Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software developers.

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.<br>


Creational design patterns
===============================================

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

<b>Abstract Factory</b>
Creates an instance of several families of classes
Builder
Separates object construction from its representation
Factory Method
Creates an instance of several derived classes
Object Pool
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
Prototype
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
Singleton
A class of which only a single instance can exist
