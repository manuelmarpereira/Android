Design Patterns
===============================================

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.<br>

These patterns can be classified in three categories: <b>Creational</b>, <b>Structural</b> and <b>Behavioral</b><br>


Creational design patterns
===============================================

These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

<b>Abstract Factory,</b>
Creates an instance of several families of classes <br>

<b>Builder,</b>
Separates object construction from its representation<br>

<b>Factory Method,</b>
Creates an instance of several derived classes<br>

<b>Prototype,</b>
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned<br>

<b>Singleton,</b>
A class of which only a single instance can exist<br><br>


Structural design patterns
===============================================

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.


<b>Adapter,</b>
Match interfaces of different classes<br>

<b>Bridge,</b>
Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation<br>

<b>Composite,</b>
A tree structure of simple and composite objects<br>

<b>Decorator,</b>
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically<br>

<b>Facade,</b>
A single class that represents an entire subsystem<br>

<b>Flyweight,</b>
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing<br>

<b>Proxy,</b>
An object representing another object<br><br>


Behavioral design patterns
===============================================

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.


<b>Chain of responsibility</b>
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects<br>

<b>Command</b>
Encapsulate a command request as an object<br>

<b>Interpreter</b>
A way to include language elements in a program<br>

<b>Iterator</b>
Sequentially access the elements of a collection<br>

<b>Mediator</b>
Defines simplified communication between classes<br>

<b>Memento</b>
Capture and restore an object's internal state<br>

<b>Null Object</b>
Designed to act as a default value of an object<br>

<b>Observer</b>
A way of notifying change to a number of classes<br>

<b>State</b>
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes<br>

<b>Strategy</b>
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class<br>

<b>Template method</b>
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass<br>

<b>Visitor</b>
Defines a new operation to a class without change<br><br><br>
